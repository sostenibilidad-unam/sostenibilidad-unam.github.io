## Lessons from International Water Education

Unsustainable socio-economic practices manifest prominently in water
crises and water-related disasters. This turns water managers into
prototypical sustainability professionals, and important change agents
in a broader societal transformation towards sustainability. Water
education is, de facto, sustainability education. By bridging the gap
between a pedagogical and a professional view on required
sustainability competencies, experiences with water education offer
valuable insights in the context of Education for Sustainable
Development (ESD). The paper reports on recent experiences with
increasing the sustainability orientation of water education programs,
and explores key issues that require attention in ESD programs in
general.
