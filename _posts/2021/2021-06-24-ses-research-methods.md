The Routledge Handbook of Research Methods for Social-Ecological
Systems provides a synthetic guide to the range of methods that can be
employed in social-ecological systems research.

The great strength of this handbook is that, for the first time, the
wide range of approaches that are currently being tried is presented
together in one volume.
