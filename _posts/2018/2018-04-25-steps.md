Vulnerability, adaptation, transformation, resilience and many of the
key themes in sustainability science are perhaps just different ways

The Wixáritari communities, better known as Huichol, are mainly
located within the Sierra Madre Occidental, north of Jalisco state,
Mexico. These communities, like many others in the world, and
particularly in the Americas, are subject to pressures from the
‘Western’ world which are the catalyst for many changes. A few weeks
ago, we visited two of these communities (La Cebolleta and La Laguna)
where Shiara is doing her PhD research. Our objective was to engage in
two participatory mapping workshops with Huichol women to understand
how their communities have changed over time.
